# RELEASE - Location of external support modules
#
# IF YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES to this file you must subsequently
# do a "gnumake rebuild" in this application's top level
# directory.
#
# The build process does not check dependencies against files
# that are outside this application, thus you should do a
# "gnumake rebuild" in the top level directory after EPICS_BASE
# or any other external module pointed to below is rebuilt.
#
# Host- or target-specific settings can be given in files named
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#  RELEASE.Common.$(T_A)
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)
#
# This file should ONLY define paths to other support modules,
# or include statements that pull in similar RELEASE files.
# Build settings that are NOT module paths should appear in a
# CONFIG_SITE file.

TEMPLATE_TOP=$(EPICS_BASE)/templates/makeBaseApp/top

# Defines the pre-built bundle location or left blank for easy build.

BUNDLE=

# This allows the plugin library to be build against the framework library.
# This must be defind as an absolute path - you cannot use $(TOP) here.
# This is because QE_FRAMEWORK variable called up by the plugin project file.
# However, on Linux the following works: QE_FRAMEWORK=$(shell readlink -f $(TOP) )
#
QE_FRAMEWORK=$(BUNDLE)/gui/qeframework

# Modify this to reference to __your__ local ACAI installation.
# 
ACAI=$(BUNDLE)/epics/acai

# Modify this to reference to __your__ local AD Support installation.
# Uncomment if needed; not required if PVAccess is not support defined.
#
# ADSUPPORT=$(BUNDLE)/det/ADSupport

# EPICS_BASE usually appears last so other apps can override stuff:
# Modify this to reference to __your__ local EPICS base installation.
#
EPICS_BASE=$(BUNDLE)/epics/base

# These lines allow developers to override these RELEASE settings
# without having to modify this file directly.
#
-include $(TOP)/../RELEASE.local
-include $(TOP)/../RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).local
-include $(TOP)/configure/RELEASE.local
