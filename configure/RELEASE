# RELEASE - Location of external support modules
#
# IF YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES to this file you must subsequently
# do a "gnumake rebuild" in this application's top level
# directory.
#
# The build process does not check dependencies against files
# that are outside this application, thus you should do a
# "gnumake rebuild" in the top level directory after EPICS_BASE
# or any other external module pointed to below is rebuilt.
#
# Host- or target-specific settings can be given in files named
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#  RELEASE.Common.$(T_A)
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)
#
# This file should ONLY define paths to other support modules,
# or include statements that pull in similar RELEASE files.
# Build settings that are NOT module paths should appear in a
# CONFIG_SITE file.

TEMPLATE_TOP=$(EPICS_BASE)/templates/makeBaseApp/top

# Defines the pre-built bundle location or left blank for formal build.
#
BUNDLE=

# This must be defind as an absolute path - you cannot use $(TOP) here.
# This is because QE_FRAMEWORK variable called up by the plugin project file.
# On Linux the following works: QE_FRAMEWORK=$(shell readlink -f $(TOP) )
#
QE_FRAMEWORK=$(BUNDLE)/gui/qeframework

# EPICS_BASE usually appears last so other apps can override stuff:
#EPICS_BASE=$(BUNDLE)/epics/base
EPICS_BASE=/usr/local/epics/R3.14.12/base

# end
