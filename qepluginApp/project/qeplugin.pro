# To alanyse code performance using the GNU gprof profiling tool:
# - Include the following two lines
# - Clean all
# - Run qmake
# - Rebuild all
# - Run the program
# - analyse the results with the command: gprof <your-program-name>
#QMAKE_CXXFLAGS_DEBUG += -pg
#QMAKE_LFLAGS_DEBUG += -pg

# To look at optimised performance (with or without the profileing above, include the following:
#QMAKE_CXXFLAGS_DEBUG += -O2

# Include the following gdbmacros line for debugging only
#SOURCES += <YOUR-QTSDK-DIRECTORY>/share/qtcreator/gdbmacros/gdbmacros.cpp

#===========================================================
# Since Qt 4.7.4, enable-auto-import is required to avoid a crash on windows when the qwt dll is loaded
# Depending on compiler the '-W1' may or may not be required. If an error relating to nable-auto-import occurs (missing leading -e) then use -W1 option
