/// This class provides a thin wrapper around the QDialog class, specifically the
/// exec function. There are two issues with the standard QDialog when exec-ed.
///
/// a) if the dialog has no parent and there is a single application form open then
///    the dialog is centred over the form - which is good. However if two or more forms
///    are open, it appears in the centre of the screen - okay but not ideal; and
///
/// b) when scaling applied (even null scaling) this confuses the dialog and it
///    appears in the top left corner of the screen which is not acceptable.
///
/// The overaloded wrapper function allows a widget to be specified, and if specified
/// the dialog is centred over the widget.
