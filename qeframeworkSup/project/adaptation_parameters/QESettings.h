/// This class provides access to user defined settings. The setting file
/// is expected to conform to the QSettings::IniFormat, i.e. like a windows
/// style .ini file.
///
/// The types of data that my be extracted from an option are bool, QString,
/// int and double; These are accessed by the associated getXxxx () functions
/// where Xxxx is one of Bool, String, Int and Float.
///
/// Each of these function takes a default value of the appropriate type which
/// is returned to the caller if the value is not defined or, as in the case of
/// numerical values, is ill-defined.
///
/// Numeric validity is defined by QString::toInt () and QString::toDouble ()
/// Do note that QString::toInt () does not accept 0x... hexadecimal or
/// 0... octal numbers.
///
/// The class also provides a number of addironal conveniance functions that
/// are described below.
///
/// This class is one of several provided to access configuration data such
/// as from environment variables, command line options and settings. They all
/// provide a similar API.
