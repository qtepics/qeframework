/// This class provides a means to access environment variables.
///
/// The types of data that my be extracted from an option are bool, QString,
/// int and double; These are accessed by the associated getXxxx () functions
/// where Xxxx is one of Bool, String, Int and Float.
///
/// Each of these function takes a default value of the appropriate type which
/// is returned to the caller if the value is not defined or, as in the case of
/// numerical values, is ill-defined.
///
/// Numeric validity is defined by QString::toInt () and QString::toDouble ()
/// Do note that QString::toInt () does not accept 0x... hexadecimal or
/// 0... octal numbers.
///
/// The environment variable name is formed by concating the prefix and
/// the suffix and conveting this to upper case if needs be. The prefix
/// can be specified when the object is constucted otherwise the default
/// prefix is used when no prefix provided. Example prefix could be "QE_".
///
/// This class is one of several provided to access configuration data such
/// as from environment variables, command line options and settings. They all
/// provide a similar API.
