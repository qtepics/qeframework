/*!
    This class holds formatting instructions and uses them to convert between an integer and a QVariant of any type.
    It is generally set up with it's formatting instructions and then passed to a QEInteger class that will sink and source integer data to widgets or other code.
    It is used to convert data to and from a QCaObject (which sources and sinks data in the form of a QVariant where
    the QVariant reflects the underlying variable data type) and the QEInteger class.
    An example of a requirement for integer data is a combo box which must determine an integer index to select a menu option.
