/*
  This class is based on the Qt label widget. It is NOT a CA aware widget.
  It does, however, use the QEWidget and its VariableNameManager base class to manage substituting
  the label's text in the same way most other widgets manage substitutions in variable names.
  It is tighly integrated with the base class QEWidget. Refer to QEWidget.cpp for details, but watch
  out for references to varable names when it is actually just talking about the text that will be
  displayed in the QLabel widget.
  This widget is required to implement some virtual functions required by QEWidget for
  managing data connections. These functions are just stubs.
