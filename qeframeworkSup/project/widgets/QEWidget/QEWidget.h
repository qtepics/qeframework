/**
  This class is used as a base for all CA aware wigets, such as QELabel, QESpinBox, etc.
  It manages common issues including creating a source of CA data updates, handling error,
  warning and status messages, and setting tool tips based on variable names.

  Note, there is tight integration between the CA aware widget classes, this class, and its
  base classes, especially VariableManager, VariableNameManager and QEToolTip.

  In particular, the VariableManager class manages QCaObject classes that stream updates to the
  CA aware widgets. But the VariableManager class, however, doesn't know how to format the data,
  or how the updates will be used.
  To resolve this, the VariableManager class asks a parent class (such as QELabel) to create the
  QCaObject class in what ever flavour it wants, by calling the virtual function createQcaItem.
  A QELabel, for example, wants string updates so it creates a QEString which is based on a
  QCaObject class and formats all updates as strings.

  The CA aware parent class (such as QELabel) defines a variable by calling VariableNameManager::setVariableName().
  The VariableNamePropertyManager class calls the establishConnection function of the CA aware parent class, such as QELabel
  when it has a new variable name.

  This class uses its base QEToolTip class to format tool tips. that class in turn calls the CA aware parent class
  (such as QELabel) directly to make use of a new tool tip.


  After construction, a CA aware widget is activated (starts updating) by VariableManager calling its
  establishConnection() function in one of two ways:

   1) The variable name or variable name substitutions is changed by calling setVariableName
      or setVariableNameSubstitutions respectively. These functions are in the VariableNameManager class.
      The VariableNamePropertyManager calls a virtual function establishConnection() which is implemented by the CA aware widget.
      This is how a CA aware widget is activated in 'designer'. It occurs when 'designer' updates the
      variable name property or variable name substitution property.

   2) When an QEForm widget is created, resulting in a set of CA aware widgets being created by loading a UI file
      contining plugin definitions.
      After loading the plugin widgets, code in the QEForm class calls the activate() function in the VariableManager base of
      this class (QEWiget).
      The activate() function calls  establishConnection() in the CA aware widget for each variable. This simulates
      what the VariableNamePropertyManager does as each variable name is entered (see 1, above, for details)

  No matter which way a CA aware widget is activated, the establishConnection() function in the CA aware widget is called
  for each variable. The establishConnection() function asks this QEWidget base class, by calling the createConnection()
  function, to perform the tasks common to all CA aware widgets for establishing a stream of CA data.

  The createConnection() function sets up the widget 'tool tip', then immedietly calls (through VariableManager::createVariable)
  the CA aware widget back asking it to create an object based on QCaObject. This object will supply a stream of CA update
  signals to the CA aware object in a form that it needs. For example a QELabel creates a QEString object. The QEString class
  is based on the QCaObject class and converts all update data to a strings which is required for updating a Qt label widget.
  This class stores the QCaObject based class.

  After the establishConnection() function in the CA aware widget has called createConnection(), the remaining task of the
  establishConnection() function is to connect the signals of the newly created QCaObject based classes to its own slots
  so that data updates can be used. For example, a QELabel connects the 'stringChanged' signal
  from the QEString object to its setLabelText slot.
