class changeEventFilter; // Forward declaration

/*!
  This class adds common style support to all QE widgets if required.

  Standard properties for all QE widgets specify a style to be applied for user, scientist, and engineer mode.
  Also QE widgets can specify data or status related style changes.

  The syntax for all Style Sheet strings used by this class is the standard Qt Style Sheet syntax.
  For example, 'background-color: red'. Refer to Qt Style Sheets Reference for full details.

  Note, as well as the large number of defined Style Sheet properties, the Style Sheet syntax allows setting any widget property using the 'qproperty' property.
  For example 'qproperty-geometry:rect(10 10 100 100);'
  Caution, any amount of weird behaviour can be effected using Style Sheet strings.
  Without carefull consideration they should only be used for simple visualisation effects such as altering the backgrouond color.

  All QE widgets (eg, QELabel, QELineEdit) have an instance of this class as they based on
  QEWidget which itself uses this class as a base class.

  To use the functionality provided by this class, QE widgets must include the following:

    \li Q_PROPERTY(QString styleSheet READ styleSheet WRITE setStyleSheet  DESIGNABLE false)
    \li Q_PROPERTY(QString defaultStyle READ getStyleDefault  WRITE setStyleDefault)
    \li Q_PROPERTY(QString userLevelUserStyle READ getStyleUser WRITE setStyleUser)
    \li Q_PROPERTY(QString userLevelScientistStyle READ getStyleScientist WRITE setStyleScientist)
    \li Q_PROPERTY(QString userLevelEngineerStyle READ getStyleEngineer WRITE setStyleEngineer)

  To use this class to manage style changes related to data and status the QE widget must include the following:

    \li On presenation of new data call updateDataStyle() with the Style Sheet string related to the new data (if any).
    \li On change of data status, call updateStatusStyle() with the Style Sheet string related to the new status (if any).

  Note, this class notes the initial style when instantiated and uses that style as the base style for
  all style changes. This means any style changes not performed through this class will be lost the next
  time this class changes the style.

  Note, the stylesheet built by this class is not actually applied if the widget being managed is disabled.
  Instead it is noted and applied if and when the widget becomed enabled.
  Changes that affect the style will still cause a regeneration of the style while the widget is disabled, but the
  updated style will not be applied until the widget is enabled.
