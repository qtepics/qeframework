/**
 * A class to manage user messages.
 *
 * This class passes messages between widgets and application code
 *
 * This class is used as a base class.
 *
 * Messages are sent by calling sendMessage()
 * Messages are received by implementing newMessage() in the derived class.
 *
 * Messages can be filtered based on a source ID or a form ID
 *
 * The derived widget is free to set the source ID to any value
 *
 * Derived form widgets (QEForm) get a unique form ID using getNextMessageFormId()
 * (as well as being able to set a source ID like any other QE widget) and pass
 * this unique form ID to all widgets within the form using the ContainerProfile class.
 *
 * Messages sent by a QE widget are received by all QE widgets and can filter the messages
 * required by form ID and source ID.
 * The form ID is under the management of the QEForm widget, the source ID is under
 * the control of the GUI designer.
 *
 * The QEForm widget does not display messages, but re-send them using its own
 * form ID. Read on to see how this can be used.
 *
 * Widgets that generate messages, and widgets (or application code) that use messages
 * can be set up as follows:
 *
 * - Application wide logging:
 *   An application with a single log window can can base a class on the UserMessage class
 *   and set up filtering to receive all messages.
 *   An application with log messages for seperate windows containing QEForm
 *   widgets (such as QEGui) can base each window class on the UserMessage class, then
 *   set up filtering for the appropriate form ID.
 *
 * - Logging within a QEForm.
 *   A logging widget can be set to filter matching on the current form and so will pick up
 *   messages from any sibling widget. This includes messages from a sibling widget which is
 *   a nested QEForm. Whatever messages that nested form is set to receive, it will resend
 *   to its siblings. For example, if it is set to receive messages from the widgets it
 *   contains, these are resent up one level to the main form.
 *   If messages are dealt with within the nested QEForm (for example, it may have its own
 *   logging QE widget) then the nested QEForm could be set up not to filter and resend any messages.
