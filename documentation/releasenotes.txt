==================================================================================================
Changes between 3.3.1 and 3.2.4 (this includes changes to all branches and tags and may include changes not related to this release)

SUMMARY:
Many widgets now emit a connection/disconnection signal and the dbValueChanged signal is overloaded to carry various data types.
.
The context menu has been improved to detect array PVs and offer the option to plot the PV or show in a histogram.
.
Added mouse middle button support to copy the variable name to clip-board and show the name on the status bar.
.
All single variable widgets now provide an arrayIndex property that allows the selection of the element of
an array PV to be displayed and/or written to.
.
Ensure successful building against Qt5.
.
QEGui regularly auto-saves the current configuration to allow restoration following a failure, and also saves the
configuration on exit to allow a user to return to where they left off.
.
New QEPvFrame widget added that allows the selection of background pixmap based on the value of a PV.
.
Improvements to the following widgets (refer to release details):
QEAnalogSlider
QEComboBox
QEImage
QEConfiguredLayout

epicsQt: Ensure markers do not go off screen. Change 37841 by starritt

Ensure uint64_t is available for all compilers Change 37846 by rhydera

Fix bug where CA data events queued onto the Qt event queue could be referenced after they had been deleted by the queueing system. While they were de-referenced after they were processed, they were not de-referenced if the queueing system deleted them before they were processed - for example, when a window was being closed, or the application was being shut down, while heavily loaded and with queued data events. Solution was to dereference them within their own destructor. Change 37847 by rhydera

Remove testing delay loop submitted by accident Change 37853 by rhydera

When starting QEGui with -s switch, use ActionRequest mechanism to start any new GUIs requested as this will present any existing GUIs rather than always creating a new (potentially duplicate) GUI.
Also add checks to only process a stream of startup parameters if from the same version of QEGui.

Update QESpinBox, QESlider, QEBitStatus and QEAnalogSlider to use SingleVariableMethods
class and honour arrayIndex for both read and writes. Change 38032 by starritt

Add QEImage dataTypeVariable property. This can be set to an EPICS variable from which
an AreaDetector data type can be read. If set, the image bit depth will be infered from
the data type. If the infered bit depth should be 32 (data type is UInt32) then it is set
to 31 to avoid some 32 bit integer arithmatic problems. This is a temporary fix. Also
extend QEImage slots to hide and show area markups. Change 38038 by rhydera

In QEImage, limit bit depth to 24 bit. Contrast brightness code uses 'int' to simplify
interaction with sliders. All int types should be changed to long and slider interaction
scaled acccordingly. Note, max and min values in contrast/brightness code can be many
multiples of pixel range (so well above 32 bits). Change 38040 by rhydera

Ensure bit depth shown correctly in QEImage statistics. Change 38042 by rhydera

Process 32 bit bit depth correctly. Change 38043 by rhydera

Make QEComboBox to use SingleVariableMethods and honour arrayIndex for both read
and writes.  Change 38053 by starritt

When converting a C string to a std::string limit its length to the relevent maximum EPICS string length only when it is actually too long.
Previously this function was achieved by always using the std::string "from buffer" constructor. This resulted in a std::string that was always the maximum size and contained rubbish when the input string was less than the maximum size. For a short string, the  "from buffer" constructor will copy the string, the zero terminator and whatever junk is following. Change 36169 by rhydera

Fix bug introduced in revision 1795. QEForm creation adds macro
substitutions specific for the QEForm before the form is created, and
removes them after creating the form. r1795 changed the macro addition
to be priority macros (first to be processed when working through the
macro substitution list). Previously they were added onto the end of the
list of macros (and processed last). After creating the form, the last
set of macros were still being removed. This had no effect if the list
of macros was empty to start with as the macros added for form creation
were still removed as they were the only set in the list.
Also minor enhancement to help dialog.

	Tidy application exit. In particular, return from exit slot after calling QCoreApplication::exit as, unlike C standard lib exit, this method returns to the caller (after forcing the event loop to exit).
	Not doing this caused the application to hang on some platforms since (probably) event processing was halted then an attempt  to present a message box was made.

Save and restore Mainwindow titles. Don't just rely on the title to be
correctly set by the GUI in the main window, and somethines there isn't
one - such as when the GUI consists only of docks.

when looking for an existing GUI to present - when asked to launch a GUI
such as from a customised menu item, or QEPush button, attempt to match
the main window title, if a Main window displaying the correct GUI is
not found. this is required since a main window may not be displaying
any central GUIs. For example, when it contains nothing (perhaps used
only for it's menus) or contains only docks.

QEWidget::setVariableNameAndSubstitutions() instead.

Replace 'display alarm state' boolean with 'display alarm state option'
enumeration. 'Display alarm state' property is still present, but
documented as deprecated, and is not 'designable' so while honoured when
read in a .ui file, is no longer available when creating .ui files.
'Display alarm state options' include 'Always' (same as 'display alarm
state' = true), 'Never' (same as 'display alarm state' = false) and
'WhenInAlarm' (which could not be represented with the original
boolean).

In QEImage, don't use image display controls to get pixel value ranges
until they have been initialised. This fixes the problem where 16 bit
images are displayed too bright until image display controls have been
touched.
Also, scale minimum and maximum value sliders in image display controls
to pixel range (previously assumed 0-256). This fixes the problem where
sliders could only be used to set low and high pixel values to 256 for
16 bit images

hidden latter if required when the dock action is added to a

In QE buttons, when setting the style to force justification, the
padding was also set away from the default, which means when the text
just fits at design time, it may not when used. To avoid this the
horizontal padding is set zero and the vertical padding is set to the
defaults when applying a style to control the justification. Also, since
'horizontal center' is the default anyway, no style is imposed if the
requested horizontal justification is center anyway.

==================================================================================================
Changes between 2.8.0 and 2.7.1 (this includes changes to all branches and tags and may include changes no related to this release)

SUMMARY:
QEframework customisation:
==========================
The QE framework has always facilitated custom application development, but has attempted to reduce the need for custom applications by providing a rich presentation application (QEGui) and a wide range of QE widgets that allow sophisicated requirements to be fully satisfied by generic QE framework components. This release includes enhancements to support this philosophy as follows:
- QE widget / application interaction.
    Applications can easily interact with named widgets in a dynamicly loaded GUI. An application can load a .ui file, then make a request to the QE framework that one of its tool bar buttons be associated with a particular function of a named QE widget in the loaded GUI. For example, the new QEGui customisation system uses this functionality to allow a custom menu item to be added that will interact with specific QE widgets in a dynamicly loaded GUI.
.
- Externalisation of QE widget controls.
    Applications can request QE widgets hand over user interface controls for hosting within some part of the application. For example, the QEImage widget can display recorder/playback controls as part of the widget. A QEGui application customisation may request that a QEImage widget in a GUI hand over these recorder controls to be loaded into a dock.
.
- QEGui customisation...
    Without customisation the QEGui application is a rich generic display manager. Customisation files can be applied to allow QEGui to function as a specialised application rather than just a display manager. For example, application specific menu bar menus and items can be added to interact directly with QE widgets loaded from .ui files, interact with widgets within GUIs and launch other applications.

Enhanced functionality:
=======================
Utilise CA priorities to ensure timely display of low volume scalar information.
Tab detatch

New widgets and classes:
========================
QEUtilities: 
 This class provides a number of general purpose utility/support functions used by a number of the QE Framework widgets.
 All the functions are static and this class maintains no state data. The header file (QECommon.h) also provides a number of utility macros.
 This class is exported from the framework as the functionality may be useful in the development of 3rd party widgets. 

QEStripChart/QEPlotter
 These widgets have been modified to use the QEGraphic class, which ensures a common look and feel, including standardised mouse and wheel zooming, animated axis re-scaling; andp rovides wrapper functions to hide QWT version API changes.

QEResizeableFrame. 
 Internally used widget that allows a frame edge to be selected and dragged in order to resize the frame. 
 It is not available as a designer widget.

QEArchiveStatus
 Provides status on the archives (traditional channel archivers) defined by the QE_ARCHIVE_LIST environment variable, namely hostname, port and endpoint as defined by QE_ARCHIVE_LIST together with status, number of indices available, number read and PV count.

QEArchiveNameSearch
 While the strip chart uses a strict name search using regular expressions, this widget provides a more relaxed means of searching for PV names available from the archiver.
 E.g. searching for "ABC  DEF" finds any PV name that contains ABC and/or DEF in any order, and is case insignificant. The usual right click context menu applies to each item in the list.

QEGeneralEdit
 When in engineer user level, and additional context menu appears "Edit PV" which brings up a generic PV value editor.
 For numeric types, it presents a QENumericEdit widget, for enumeration types it presents a QERadioGroup, and for string types is presents a QELineEdit widget to the user.

QEDialog
  This is the base class for a number of dialogs.  It allows the dialog to be centred over the widget or  window of interest as opposed to the centre of the screen.

Enhanced Widgets and classes:
=============================
QEImage enhancements:
  - User control of image display properties (brightness/contrast,
    false colour, contrast reversal, logarithmic brightness)
  - Recording and playback
  - MPEG sources (as well as CA)
  - Direct access to QEImage widgets functions from custom QEGui menu items.
  - Allow external controls so applications like QEGui can appropriate
    controls. For example, QEGui can be customised to locate the recording
    controls as a dock.
  - Add processing for more image formats.
  - Improved user intraction with image.
  - Improved integration with area detector. When a user interacts with
    an image to select a profile through the image, the generation of the
    profile data can be performed within the QEImage widget, or by area
    detector.
  - Full screen mode

Building and packaging:
=======================

Release procedures now build RPM package and tar files

Qt5 Build
Windows build under Microsoft compiler (as well as gnu)

Deprecation:
============
QE Widgets deprecated in version 2.0 have been removed. All deprecated widgets were only unique in name only, being light wrappers around current QE widgets.
For example, QCaLabel was implemented using QELabel. Any code or .ui files referencing deprecared QCa widgets can be modified to use the current version by
renaming any widget names from QCa<name> to QE<name>

In QEWidget, Correct order in which ui files were searched for (-p,
QE_UI_PATH, current_dir instead of -p, current_dir, QE_UI_PATH)
In QEForm, use variable and macro substitutions manager in QEWidget
instead of QEForm's own version (all widgets should have been cut over
to the generic mechainism in QEWidget)
When a QEForm does not have a file to display, or can't find or load it,
display a placeholder label and mark out the widget with a border around
and a cross through the area of the widget.
When loading sub forms, change the current directory to the sub form's
directory so file references added by Designer such as push button icons
can be located as designer saves file references relative to the
location it saves the ui file.

In ContainerProfile class change order of locking of shared memory used
to hold published profile reference.
In QEForm, change uiFile property to use standard variable name and
substitution mechanism, with the filename taking the place of the
variable name.
This mechism calls the widget when both variable name and macro
substitutions (or in the case of the QEForm widget, ui file name and
macro substitutions) are available.
Without this mechanism, connections were established (or in the case of
QEForm, ui files were loaded) when a variable name (ui file name)
property was set during loading, then again when the macro substitutions
property was set.
Also in QEForm, load sub forms after processing events for loading
higher level forms has completed. This means deeply nested forms and
forms with many sub forms hidden in tabs appear to load much quicker and
are interactive earlier.

Ensure the full path used to open a .ui file is passed to designer when
editing a .ui file from QEGui.
Simplify the resizing of a QEGui window to fit around a newly loaded .ui
file. NOTE: this has introduced a problem when the loaded .ui file has a
QScrollArea as it's top level. The main window is not resizes as it is
left ot the Qsroll area to manage the area it is given. Initially, the
main window should resize to fit the GUI and from then on any resizes
should cause the scroll area to act.

Improve QE framework context menu to allow standard widget context menu
to be added. for example, QELineEdit had its own edit menu and no QE
framework menu. Now QELineEdit has a QE context menu and the first item
is a sub menu containing the original edit menu. Still needs to be added
to other interactive QE widgets that up to now have not had a QE
framework context menu.

to be promptly serviced when submitted to large rapidly updating images
that are maxing out the network.
Wen QCaObject is building variant arrays (unrelated to QEByteArrays by
the way) pre-allocate the QVariantList sizes to improve performance for
large arrays.
One of the constructors for QEByteArray did not request QByteArray
signals from its QCaObject, so when used would receive no updates (as
its QCaObject would be emitting QVariantList data upates)

zoom image to other than 100%, move target markup, move beam another,
target markup is redrawn at a non scaled location)
- Remove residual debug statements.

Histogram does not display correctly when outside the pixel range. Still
need to present black and white values on sliders correctly. Sliders
range is within pixel range only.

In QEImage, Image display properties control, give the black value and
white value sliders a wide linear range covering the full pixel range,
with a narrow exponential range covering an extended area outside the
piel range. This allows fine selection of values within the pixel range,
while also allowing selection and display of values way outside the
pixel range as required for low contrast settings.

In QEWidget, Correct order in which ui files were searched for (-p,
QE_UI_PATH, current_dir instead of -p, current_dir, QE_UI_PATH)
In QEForm, use variable and macro substitutions manager in QEWidget
instead of QEForm's own version (all widgets should have been cut over
to the generic mechainism in QEWidget)
When a QEForm does not have a file to display, or can't find or load it,
display a placeholder label and mark out the widget with a border around
and a cross through the area of the widget.
When loading sub forms, change the current directory to the sub form's
directory so file references added by Designer such as push button icons
can be located as designer saves file references relative to the
location it saves the ui file.

In ContainerProfile class change order of locking of shared memory used
to hold published profile reference.
In QEForm, change uiFile property to use standard variable name and
substitution mechanism, with the filename taking the place of the
variable name.
This mechism calls the widget when both variable name and macro
substitutions (or in the case of the QEForm widget, ui file name and
macro substitutions) are available.
Without this mechanism, connections were established (or in the case of
QEForm, ui files were loaded) when a variable name (ui file name)
property was set during loading, then again when the macro substitutions
property was set.
Also in QEForm, load sub forms after processing events for loading
higher level forms has completed. This means deeply nested forms and
forms with many sub forms hidden in tabs appear to load much quicker and
are interactive earlier.

Ensure the full path used to open a .ui file is passed to designer when
editing a .ui file from QEGui.
Simplify the resizing of a QEGui window to fit around a newly loaded .ui
file. NOTE: this has introduced a problem when the loaded .ui file has a
QScrollArea as it's top level. The main window is not resizes as it is
left ot the Qsroll area to manage the area it is given. Initially, the
main window should resize to fit the GUI and from then on any resizes
should cause the scroll area to act.

to be added. for example, QELineEdit had its own edit menu and no QE
framework menu. Now QELineEdit has a QE context menu and the first item

to other interactive QE widgets that up to now have not had a QE
framework context menu.

Change widgets to set foreground style to grey when disconnected, rather
than disable the widget. Disabling the widget had the advantage of
offloading the work of presenting the widget as disconnected to Qt but
had several disadvantages including:
Could not right click on disconnected widget to get menu (a problem when
you want to get the PV name to see why it is disconnected).
Required a complicated mechanism to provide an alternative 'enable'
property that that could be overwritten by the connected/disconnected
presentation.

Avoid occasional crash when closing forms. When deleting QE widgets the
QCaObject classes signaling them with data changes would signal a
disconnection when the QCaObject was deleted. Signaling on destruction
of a QCaObject is normal if a PV is changing (where one QCaObject is
replaced with another), but if the QE widget is being deleted, the
underlying QObject is still receiving signals from the QCaObject, but
the QE widget can no longer act on them (for example to set the style to
represent 'disconnected'). Now the signals are dissconnected where
appropriate.
Also, log errors opening QEGui configuration file.

Hold off activating widgets in QEForms when a parent form is holding off
widget activation. This is important for sub forms. Even though they can
activate their contents after loading a .ui file it is likely their
filename and macro substitution properties will be set after creation
which may cause many widgets they contain to reconnect, which is
inefficient. When the top form completes loading it will activate all
widgets.

r526 | rhyder | 2013-02-11 15:49:25 +1100 (Mon, 11 Feb 2013) | 14 lines

Revert temporary change where user level style is not applied when empty
(rev 522). This was added as a quick fix where button colors were lost
when user level changed. Still need to identify the true cause of the
problem.
Revert addition of 'textSubstitution' property (rev 523). labelText
property already provides the option of applying macro substitutions to
button labels. (Note, the behaviour of the labelText property was
changed slightly so it overrides any current button text if labelText is
present)
Revert delay in connectionHandler callback (rev 524). This was added for
a bug in a specific user interface file. The bug still needs fixing, but
this temporary fix should not be in the repository (and doesn't build on
windows)

Ensure a unique instance of the published profile is created.
The details contained in the PublishedProfile class need to be shared
across the application, but they can't be just static since QE framework
library QEPlugin may be loaded twice: Once as a run time loaded dll for
an application (example QEGui) and once when a QEForm is loaded by the
Qt .ui loader. On Linux this doesn't matter - the library is mapped once
and the same mapping is returned in both cases. So any static
variables only exist once. In windows, however, the library
(QEPlugin.dll) is mapped twice and static variables are created twice.
This can be observed by printing out the address of a static variable.
The 'same' static variable will have different addresses depening on
whether it is being referenced by the application or the Qt .ui form
loader.
Debug statement are still present.

Update PDF doco from Word source

------------------------------------------------------------------------
==================================================================================================
Changes between 2.2 and 2.1

SUMMARY:

QEButton emits signals containing the write value (even when no variable) to allow selection of tabs in tab wigets
QEImage now has markup legends, and some artifacts fixed.
QEImage now writes to four areaDetector region of interest plugins.
Additional Doxygen content.
Additional guide content

DETAIL:

519
Minor type, and backout Windows specific change to project file

518:
Minor update to design doco and gnerate PDF

517:
Update version to 2.1 in preparation of package. Update design doco with
notes on QEForm and sub form resizing. Rebuild doxygen doco.

516:
Mainly doxygen comments in QEImage, but a few code tidy-ups. Make public
a couple of functions in QELabel. Document QEImage in the QEGui and User
Interface Design document.

515:
user private data class

514:
QEButtons - on click, press, or release, still write a to variable if
defined, but also emit an integer signal of the same value (if variable
is defined or not). This is useful for selecting a tab in a tab widget
on the same form. (user interface design pdf not generated)
QEImage. Extend to 4 region of interest selections.

513:
Don't antialias markup text. Artifacts were left when removing markup
text on Linux. (Because antialias resulted in some pixels drawn blended
with original image when drawn in and blended again when drawn out? Or
perhaps not antialiased when when drawn out since composition mode is
then set to 'clear' which implies no blending, so no antialiasing? )

512:
